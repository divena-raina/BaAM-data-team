## 🔗 Correlation Analysis

### Strong Correlations (|r| > 0.5)

| Variable Pair | Correlation | Interpretation |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Housing Crowded ↔ Without HS Diploma** | 0.876 | Strong positive - areas with crowded housing have higher dropout rates |
| **Per Capita Income ↔ Hardship Index** | -0.849 | Strong negative - higher income = lower hardship |
| **Below Poverty ↔ Hardship Index** | 0.803 | Strong positive - poverty strongly predicts hardship |
| **Without HS Diploma ↔ Hardship Index** | 0.803 | Strong positive - education strongly predicts hardship |
| **Below Poverty ↔ Unemployed** | 0.800 | Strong positive - poverty and unemployment co-occur |
| **Unemployed ↔ Hardship Index** | 0.792 | Strong positive - unemployment predicts hardship |
| **Without HS Diploma ↔ Per Capita Income** | -0.710 | Strong negative - education predicts income |
| **Unemployed ↔ Per Capita Income** | -0.657 | Strong negative - unemployment predicts lower income |
| **Housing Crowded ↔ Hardship Index** | 0.650 | Moderate positive - crowded housing predicts hardship |
| **Housing Crowded ↔ Per Capita Income** | -0.542 | Moderate negative - crowded housing predicts lower income |
| **Below Poverty ↔ Per Capita Income** | -0.567 | Moderate negative - poverty predicts lower income |

2. **Lincoln Park** (Hardship: 2.0) - Upscale residential
3. **Loop** (Hardship: 3.0) - Downtown business district
4. **Lake View** (Hardship: 5.0) - Trendy neighborhood

## ✅ Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ **Complete Coverage**: All 78 community areas included
- ✅ **No Duplicates**: Clean dataset with unique records
- ✅ **Valid Ranges**: All percentage values within 0-100%
- ✅ **No Negative Values**: All values logically consistent
- ✅ **High Completeness**: 99.9% complete (only 1 missing Hardship_Index value)

### Minor Issues
- ⚠️ **Missing Value**: 1 missing Hardship_Index value (1.3%)
- ⚠️ **Outliers**: 13 outliers across 4 variables (expected for socioeconomic data)

---

## 🎯 Key Insights & Conclusions

### 1. **Strong Socioeconomic Clustering**
- Clear geographic patterns of advantage/disadvantage
- North Side areas generally perform better than South/West Side
- Income inequality is stark ($8,201 vs $88,669 per capita)

### 2. **Education as Key Predictor**
- Education level (HS diploma) strongly correlates with all other variables
- Acts as a central predictor of socioeconomic outcomes
- Should be prioritized in modeling efforts

### 3. **Hardship Index as Composite Measure**
- Strongly correlated with all individual indicators
- Effectively captures overall community disadvantage
- Could serve as primary outcome variable

### 4. **Income Inequality**
- Extreme variation in per capita income across areas
- Top 5 areas earn 3-10x more than bottom 5 areas
- Clear spatial segregation by income

### 5. **Multidimensional Disadvantage**
- Areas with high poverty also tend to have:
  - High unemployment
  - Low education levels
  - Crowded housing
  - High hardship scores

## 🚀 Recommendations for Feature Selection & Modeling

### 1. **Feature Selection Strategy**
- **Include All Variables**: Each provides unique information
- **Consider Correlation**: Avoid multicollinearity in linear models
- **Prioritize Education**: Strongest predictor across outcomes
- **Use Hardship Index**: As composite outcome measure

### 2. **Modeling Considerations**
- **Standardization**: Recommended due to different scales
- **Outlier Handling**: Consider robust methods or outlier treatment
- **Geographic Clustering**: Account for spatial autocorrelation
- **Missing Data**: Minimal impact (1 missing value)

### 3. **Potential Use Cases**
- **Crime Prediction**: Use sociodemographics to predict crime rates
- **Resource Allocation**: Identify areas needing intervention
- **Policy Analysis**: Evaluate impact of socioeconomic programs
- **Urban Planning**: Inform development and investment decisions
